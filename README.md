# Project Starter
#### Disclaimer
I am wayy to late on the whole Dockertrain and makefile stuff. I know the basics to get started. However I want
to get better and get used to more Docker stuff.
## Purpose of this Repository 
I have the same struggles with all my projects I am setting up. Getting just the environment running. This is where this
repo (hopefully) comes in handy. This will be the base of my new projects and I will increase it over time to suite
my different projects needs. (i.e have a starter branch for different technology stacks)
